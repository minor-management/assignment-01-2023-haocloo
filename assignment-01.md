**1. Why is it difficult to find a bench in a shopping mall? <br>**
There could be several reasons why it is difficult to find a bench in a shopping mall. One possible reason is that some mall owners or managers may want to maximize their rental income by filling up the available space with shops or kiosks [1][2]. Another possible reason is that some mall owners or managers may want to discourage certain groups of people from loitering or occupying the benches for a long time[3]. However, benches can also have positive effects on public spaces, such as providing comfort, rest, social interaction and wellbeing for shoppers [3][4]. Therefore, it may depend on the mallâ€™s vision, strategy and target market whether they provide benches or not [5].

**2. In what ways does the Ukraine war affect your day-to-day life?<br>**
The war may affect access to information and media freedom. This may make it harder to get reliable and unbiased news about the war and other global issues [6].  The war has disrupted trade flows and energy supplies between Russia and Europe, which are both important trading partners for Malaysia [7][8]. The war may affect living costs too [7][8]. Prices of goods and services in Malaysia are increasing, such as food and fuel [7][8]. It may affect opportunities of finding jobs or scholarships in Russia or Europe after graduation.

**3. Why is big tech facing massive layoffs?<br>**
The global economic recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and its variants have reduced consumer spending and business activity [9][10].
There are other reasons like overhiring that led to inefficiences and redundancies [11][12], high inflation and interest rates that increases operational costs [11][12] and increased competition from new rivals [12][13].

**4. How do the big tech's massive layoffs affect you as students?<br>**
There might be reduced job opportunities and lower salaries for tech graduates [14][15] and increased competition and pressure for tech internships and scholarships [14][16]. In addition, employers are looking for more employees who can quickly adapt to changing markets and consumer needs [14]. In other words, students need to be more up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies.

**5. What was the financial impact of the [Ever Given cargo ship blocking the Suez Canal in 2021] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Suez_Canal_obstruction)? **

The Ever Given cargo ship blocked the Suez Canal for nearly a week in March 2021, causing a major disruption to global trade. According to some estimates, the blockage resulted in a backlog of over 400 ships waiting to pass through the canal, with an estimated $9.6 billion worth of goods being delayed each day. The blockage also affected oil prices, shipping rates, supply chains and consumer demand. The blockage caused a shortage of containers, which increased freight costs and delayed deliveries of goods. Furthermore, the blockage affected agricultural trade, as some perishable goods such as fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy products spoiled or lost value while waiting to cross the canal. The blockage also disrupted tourism and fishing activities in the Red Sea region, as some cruise ships and fishing boats had to cancel or reroute their trips.
